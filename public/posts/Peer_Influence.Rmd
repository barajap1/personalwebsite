##Propensity Score Matching
```{r}
#Transform subscriber friend count into the Treatment and control variable with Treatment being 1 and Control being 0
High_Note$Treatment <- ifelse(High_Note$subscriber_friend_cnt >= 1, 1, 0)
```
```{r}
#For those who have 1 or more subscriber friends, on average 18% of them are premuim subsribers, 
# while those who have 0 subscriber friends, on average 5%  of them are premium subscribers. 

High_Note %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean_adopter = mean(adopter))

with(High_Note, t.test(adopter ~ Treatment))
```
# Difference-in-means: pre-treatment covariates
# Let's calculate the mean for each covariate

```{r}
High_Note_cov <- c("age","male","friend_cnt","avg_friend_age","avg_friend_male","friend_country_cnt","ln_songsListened", 
              "ln_lovedTracks","posts","playlists","shouts", "tenure","good_country")
High_Note %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  select(one_of(High_Note_cov)) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(mean(., na.rm = T)))
```

```{r}
#T-test
list_of_var <- c("age","male","friend_cnt","avg_friend_age","avg_friend_male","friend_country_cnt","ln_songsListened", 
              "ln_lovedTracks","posts","playlists","shouts", "tenure","good_country")
lapply(list_of_var, function(v) {
  t.test(High_Note[, v] ~ High_Note$Treatment)
})
```

Propensity score estimation
We estimate the propensity score by running a logit model (probit also works) 
where the outcome variable is a binary variable indicating treatment status. 
what covariates should we include? For the matching to give you a causal estimate 
in the end, you need to include any covariate that is related to both the treatment 
assignment and potential outcomes. Therefore at this moment I choose to include all variables

```{r}
m_ps <- glm(Treatment ~ age + male + friend_cnt + avg_friend_age + avg_friend_male + friend_country_cnt +  
               ln_songsListened + ln_lovedTracks + posts + playlists + shouts + tenure + good_country,
             family = binomial(), data = High_Note)
summary(m_ps)
```

Using this model, we can now calculate the propensity score for each user 
It is simply the user's predicted probability of being Treated, 
given the estimates from the logit model.

```{r}
prs_df <- data.frame(pr_score = predict(m_ps, type = "response"),
                     Treatment = m_ps$model$Treatment)
head(prs_df)
```

Examining the region of common support
After estimating the propensity score, it is useful to plot histograms of the estimated propensity scores by treatment status

```{r}
labs <- paste("Treatment type:", c("1 or more friends", "0 friends"))
prs_df %>%
  mutate(SubscriberType = ifelse(Treatment == 1, labs[1], labs[2])) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pr_score)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 0.025) +
  facet_wrap(~SubscriberType) +
  xlab("Probability of Treatment") +
  theme_bw()
```

The method we use below is to find pairs of observations that have very similar propensity scores, 
but that differ in their treatment status. We use the package MatchIt for this. 
This package estimates the propensity score in the background and then matches observations based 
on the method of choice ("nearest" in this case)

```{r}
High_Note_nomiss <- High_Note %>%  # MatchIt does not allow missing values
  select(adopter, Treatment, one_of(High_Note_cov)) %>%
  na.omit()

mod_match <- matchit(Treatment ~ age + male + friend_cnt + avg_friend_age + avg_friend_male + friend_country_cnt +  
                       ln_songsListened + ln_lovedTracks + posts + playlists + shouts + tenure + good_country,
                     method = "nearest", data = High_Note_nomiss)
```

We can get some information about how successful the matching was using summary(mod_match) and plot(mod_match)

```{r}
summary(mod_match)
plot(mod_match)
```

To create a dataframe containing only the matched observations, use the match.data() function
```{r}
dta_m <- match.data(mod_match)
dim(dta_m)
```

Examining covariate balance in the matched sample
Visual Inspection
```{r}
fn_bal <- function(dta, variable) {
  dta$variable <- dta[, variable]
  dta$Treatment <- as.factor(dta$Treatment)
  support <- c(min(dta$variable), max(dta$variable))
  ggplot(dta, aes(x = distance, y = variable, color = Treatment)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 1.3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F) +
    xlab("Propensity score") +
    ylab(variable) +
    theme_bw() +
    ylim(support)
}

grid.arrange(
  fn_bal(dta_m, "age"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "male") + theme(legend.position = "none"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "friend_cnt"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "avg_friend_age") + theme(legend.position = "none"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "friend_country_cnt"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "ln_songsListened") + theme(legend.position = "none"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "ln_lovedTracks"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "playlists") + theme(legend.position = "none"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "tenure"),
  fn_bal(dta_m, "good_country") + theme(legend.position = "none"),
  nrow = 6, widths = c(1, 0.8)
)
```
Difference of Means
```{r}
dta_m %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  select(one_of(High_Note_cov)) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(mean))

lapply(High_Note_cov, function(v) {
  t.test(dta_m[, v] ~ dta_m$Treatment)
})
```
Estimating treatment effects

Estimating the treatment effect is simple once we have 
a matched sample that we are happy with. We can use a t-test:
```{r}
with(dta_m, t.test(adopter ~ Treatment))
```

Or we can use OLS with or without covariates:
```{r}
glm_treat1 <- glm(adopter ~ Treatment, data = dta_m, family = "binomial")
summary(glm_treat1)

glm_treat2 <- glm(adopter ~ age + male + friend_cnt + avg_friend_age + avg_friend_male + friend_country_cnt +  
                    ln_songsListened + ln_lovedTracks + posts + playlists + shouts + tenure + good_country + Treatment, 
                  data = dta_m, family = "binomial")
summary(glm_treat2)
```

In a logistic regression the response being modeled is the log(odds) that Y = 1
The regression coefficient gives the change in log(odds) in the response for a unit change in the predictor variable
because log(odds) are difficult to interpret, we can exponentiate them

We can see that the odds of being a premium subscriber are increased by a factor of 1.499 when and individual is male
```{r}
exp(coef(glm_treat2))
```
