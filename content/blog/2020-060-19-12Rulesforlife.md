excerpt:  "12 Rules for life"

Following Jordan Peterson 12 rules for life, I want to write my own. Keeping in mind that these can and will probably change over time which can sound contradictory because rules should not change, but I understand my limitations and understand that people change points of view. So here it goes:

1. Assume your temperament will always be somewhat childish and impatient, and set your rules accordingly, knowing that you cannot abide by rules for rules sake.  Hope to leverage your impatience toward your longer-run advantage.

2. Study the symbolic systems of art, music, literature. and religion, if only to help yourself better understand alternative points of view in political and intellectual discourse.  Don't just spend time with the creations you like right away.  Avoid "devalue and dismiss."

3. When the price goes up, buy less.  Try to understand what the price really is, however, and good luck with that.

4. Marry well.

5. Organize at least some significant portion of your knowledge of the world in terms of place, whether by country, region, or city.  If you do that, virtually every person will be interesting to you, if only because almost everyone has some valuable knowledge of particular places.

6. When playing sports stay "Loose and Aggresive "

7. Learn how to learn from those who offend you.

8. Cultivate mentors, and be willing to serve as mentors to others.  This never loses its importance.

9. Learn multiple languages

10. Be aware of your circle of influence and realize that the world is greater than yours

11. 

12. 


Peterson's Rules: 

1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back

2. Treat yourself like you would someone you are responsible for helping

3. Make friends with people who want the best for you

4. Compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today

5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them

6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticise the world

7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)

8. Tell the truth - or, at least, don't lie

9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't

10. Be precise in your speech

11. Do not bother children when they are skate-boarding

12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street
